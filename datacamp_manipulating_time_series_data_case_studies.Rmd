# Chapter 1 - Flight Data

## Flight Data

```{r}
#View the structure of the flights data
str(flights)

#Examine the first five rows of the flights data
head(flights, n = 5)

#Identify class of the column containing date information
class(flights$date)

```

## Encoding your flight sdata
```{r}
# Convert date column to a time-based class
flights$date <- as.Date(flights$date)

# Convert flights to an xts object using as.xts
flights_xts <- as.xts(flights[ , -c(5)], order.by = flights$date)

# Check the class of flights_xts
class(flights_xts)

# Examine the first five lines of flights_xts
head(flights_xts, 5)

```

## Exploring Flight Data
```{r}
# Identify the periodicity of flights_xts
periodicity(flights_xts)

# Identify the number of periods in flights_xts
nmonths(flights_xts)

# Find data on flights arriving in BOS in June 2014
flights_xts["2014-06"]

```

## Visualizing FLight Data
```{r}
# Use plot.xts() to view total monthly flights into BOS over time
plot.xts(flights_xts$total_flights)

# Use plot.xts() to view monthly delayed flights into BOS over time
plot.xts(flights_xts$delay_flights)

# Use plot.zoo() to view all four columns of data in their own panels
plot.zoo(flights_xts, plot.type = "multiple", ylab = labels)

# Use plot.zoo() to view all four columns of data in one panel
plot.zoo(flights_xts, plot.type = "single", lty = lty)
legend("right", lty = lty, legend = labels)

```

## Calculate Time Series Trends
```{r}
# Calculate percentage of flights delayed each month: pct_delay
flights_xts$pct_delay <- (flights_xts$delay_flights / flights_xts$total_flights) * 100

# Use plot.xts() to view pct_delay over time
plot.xts(flights_xts$pct_delay)

# Calculate percentage of flights cancelled each month: pct_cancel
flights_xts$pct_cancel <- (flights_xts$cancel_flights / flights_xts$total_flights) * 100


# Calculate percentage of flights diverted each month: pct_divert
flights_xts$pct_divert <- (flights_xts$divert_flights / flights_xts$total_flights) * 100


# Use plot.zoo() to view all three trends over time
plot.zoo(x = flights_xts[ , c("pct_delay", "pct_cancel", "pct_divert")])

```

## Saving Time - I
```{r}
# Save your xts object to rds file using saveRDS
saveRDS(object = flights_xts, file = "flights_xts.rds")

# Read your flights_xts data from the rds file
flights_xts2 <- readRDS("flights_xts.rds")

# Check the class of your new flights_xts2 object
class(flights_xts2)

# Examine the first five rows of your new flights_xts2 object
head(flights_xts2, 5)

```

## Saving Time - II
```{r}
# Export your xts object to a csv file using write.zoo
write.zoo(flights_xts, file = "flights_xts.csv", sep = ",")

# Open your saved object using read.zoo
flights2 <- read.zoo("flights_xts.csv", sep = ",", FUN = as.Date, header = TRUE, index.column = 1)

# Encode your new object back into xts
flights_xts2 <- as.xts(flights2)

# Examine the first five rows of your new flights_xts2 object
head(flights_xts2, 5)

```

# Chapter 2- Weather Data

## exploring temperature data

```{r}
# View the structure of each object
str(temps_1)
str(temps_2)

# View the first and last rows of temps_1
head(temps_1)
tail(temps_1)

# View the first and last rows of temps_2
head(temps_2)
tail(temps_2)
```

## Merging using rbind
```{r}
# Confirm that the date column in each object is a time-based class
class(temps_1)
class(temps_2)

# Encode your two temperature data frames as xts objects
temps_1_xts <- as.xts(temps_1[, -4], order.by = temps_1$date)
temps_2_xts <- as.xts(temps_2[, -4], order.by = temps_2$date)

# View the first few lines of each new xts object to confirm they are properly formatted
head(temps_1_xts)
head(temps_2_xts)

# Use rbind to merge your new xts objects
temps_xts <- rbind(temps_1_xts, temps_2_xts)

# View data for the first 3 days of the last month of the first year in temps_xts
first(last(first(temps_xts, "1 year"), "1 month"), "3 days")

```

## Visualizing Boston Winters
```{r}
# Identify the periodicity of temps_xts
periodicity(temps_xts)

# Generate a plot of mean Boston temperature for the duration of your data
plot.xts(temps_xts$mean)

# Generate a plot of mean Boston temperature from November 2010 through April 2011
plot.xts(temps_xts$mean["2010-11/2011-4"])

# Use plot.zoo to generate a single plot showing mean, max, and min temperatures during the same period 
plot.zoo(temps_xts["2010-11/2011-4"], plot.type = "single", lty = lty)
```

## Subsetting and adjusting periodicity
```{r}
# Subset your temperature data to include only 2010 through 2015: temps_xts_2
temps_xts_2 <- temps_xts["2010/2015"]

# Use to.period to convert temps_xts_2 to monthly periodicity
temps_monthly <- to.period(temps_xts_2, period = "months", OHLC = FALSE, indexAt = "firstof")

# Compare the periodicity and duration of temps_monthly and flights_xts 
periodicity(temps_monthly)
periodicity(flights_xts)

```
## Generating a monthly average
```{r}
# Split temps_xts_2 into separate lists per month
monthly_split <- split(temps_xts_2$mean , f = "months")

# Use lapply to generate the monthly mean of mean temperatures
mean_of_means <- lapply(monthly_split, FUN = "mean")

# Use as.xts to generate an xts object of average monthly temperature data
temps_monthly <- as.xts(as.numeric(mean_of_means), order.by = index)
 
# Compare the periodicity and duration of your new temps_monthly and flights_xts 
periodicity(temps_monthly)
periodicity(flights_xts)

```
## Using merge and plottign over time
```{r}
# Use merge to combine your flights and temperature objects
flights_temps <- merge(flights_xts, temps_monthly)

# Examine the first few rows of your combined xts object
head(flights_temps)

# Use plot.zoo to plot these two columns in a single panel
plot.zoo(flights_temps[,c("pct_delay", "temps_monthly")], plot.type = "single", lty = lty)
legend("topright", lty = lty, legend = labels, bg = "white")

```
## Expanding your data
```{r}
# Confirm the periodicity and duration of the vis and wind data
periodicity(vis)
periodicity(wind)

# Merge vis and wind with your existing flights_temps data
flights_weather <- merge(flights_temps, vis, wind)

# View the first few rows of your flights_weather data
head(flights_weather)

```

# Chapter 3 - Economic Data

# Chapter 4 - Sports Data
